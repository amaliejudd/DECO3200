                        <p>It is a common misconception that individuals can't make a difference in the fight against
                            climate change. However, individual action is part of the collective. So, while you won’t
                            save the world on your own, you might be part of the solution. It only takes 3.5% of the
                            population actively participating in a given issue to cause real political change. </p>

                        <p>Australia is not on track to meet its Paris target. The government’s own published data
                            shows our greenhouse gas emissions have been rising consistently for five years. To
                            be on track to meet our target, our emissions would need to be falling - not rising. </p>

                        <p>Australia’s Paris target is to reduce our emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030.
                            This is one of the least ambitious targets amongst developed countries. If other countries
                            adopted Australia’s target the world would be heading for more than three degrees of
                            warming.</p>

                        <p>Australia has the highest emissions per capita in the developed world. It is true that
                            Australia’s emissions per capita have fallen more than most countries, but this is from an
                            extraordinarily high baseline, and has largely been driven by rapid population growth. Even
                            with this drop, we still have the highest per capita emissions in the developed world. Our
                            emissions per capita are higher than Saudi Arabia, a country not known for its action on
                            climate change. Ultimately, our international targets are not based on per capita emissions.

                        <p>Global warming is causing the Earth’s average surface temperature to increase. This is
                            not
                            only making heatwaves and droughts more likely but it’s also causing changes to our
                            natural
                            climate systems. These changes are making extreme weather events more likely and more
                            severe. For example, hurricanes and storms are becoming more intense, moving slower and
                            taking longer to die down. Because of where we are, the UK & Ireland are likely to get
                            more
                            rain and wind as a result of climate change while New York will see more snow.</p>

                        <h3 class="shadow">"CLIMATE CHANGE <br> IS A FUTURE PROBLEM"</h3>
                        <p>This is no longer an excuse not to act on climate change and push the burden onto future
                            generations. Last year, the world’s leading climate scientists warned we only have 12 years
                            to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5C and avoid climate breakdown.

                            We’re already seeing the devastating effects of climate change on global food supplies,
                            increasing migration, conflict, disease and global instability, and this will only get worse
                            if we don’t act now. Man-made climate change is the biggest environmental crisis of our
                            time. It threatens the future of the planet that we depend on for our survival and we're the
                            last generation that can do something about it.</p>
